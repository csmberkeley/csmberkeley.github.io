    <h5 class="label">FAQ</h5>

    <h6 class="sublabel">What are you looking for in a Junior Mentor?</h6>
    <p class="info">We look for applicants who are dedicated to their students. This could be in the form of previous tutoring experience, mastery of the material, and flexible time commitments. While we do take grades into account, it is not a prioritized metric. Many successful mentors have received a variety of grades.</p>

    <h6 class="sublabel">Are there any prerequisites to be a Junior Mentor?</h6>
    <p class="info">There are no formal requirements, but we prefer mentors to have had at least one semester of lab assisting, either in past semesters or concurrently.</p>

    <h6 class="sublabel">What is the time commitment for a Junior Mentor?</h6>
    <p class="info">We estimate 3-4 hours/week. We break it down as follows: Senior Meeting (1 hour), Tutoring Meeting (1 hour), Other Preparations: 1-2 hours.</p>

    <h6 class="sublabel">Can I be a junior mentor without meeting with a senior mentor?</h6>
    <p class="info">You may. We have another category of mentor called “Associate Mentor” in which you have extensive experience in the class you’re mentoring for. We will be more strict with acceptances as an Associate Mentor and generally encourage first time tutors to be a Junior Mentor and receive guidance from Senior Mentors.</p>

    <h6 class="sublabel">Can I get units for being a mentor?</h6>
    <p class="info">Yes! Each Junior Mentor can receive 1 unit of P/NP credit. We will provide you the appropriate CCN when the time comes. You are not required to enroll.</p>

    <h6 class="sublabel">Can I also do other forms of tutoring other than group?</h6>
    <p class="info">Junior Mentors’ primary responsibility is to host group tutoring. However, Junior Mentors may also choose to do 1-1 tutoring in conjunction with CS 98, Introduction to Teaching Computer Science. For other forms of support, you are free to lab assist or assist in office hours or guerrilla sections, provided you have received a passing grade in your respective class.</p>

    <h6 class="sublabel">What is this CS 370?</h6>
    <p class="info">CS 370, or CS 98, Introduction to Teaching Computer Science, is a class for aspiring teachers, providing guidance to lab assistants on how to teach computer science and put it into practice. It offers 1-1 tutoring for the class of your choice. Many of our mentors have taken this class concurrently or previously, and is highly recommended!</p>

    <h6 class="sublabel">Who can I contact if I have more questions?</h6>
    <p class="info">Feel free to email us at <a href="MAILTO:mentors@berkeley.edu">mentors@berkeley.edu</a> if you have any questions or concerns!</p>
