My favorite artist of all time is definitely Taylor Swift (although her new songs are bad). I did competitive math for a bit in highschool and I really enjoy the topics covered in 70. I think the best way to learn math is to understand the fundamentals, and then gain an intuition through lots of practice! I hope that I can help you achieve your goals in 70 for this semester! </td>

I'm also involved in AI research here at Berkeley so come talk to me if you're interested in that. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, playing chess, attempting to make food (I wouldn't call it cooking), playing guitar, and playing basketball.

My favorite artists are J-Cole, Logic, and Big Sean. Besides music, my hobbies include playing chess, basketball, and poker. I also love finding new places to eat! My favorite place in Berkeley so far is Crunch, a Korean Restaurant on Shattuck. In addition to teaching with CSM, I also teach as a lab and office hour tutor for 16a and as a 61a tutor via cs 370. I'm also into machine learning and recently started doing research with robots and lego blocks under Ken Goldberg in the AUTOLAB.  </td>

My interests are pretty multifaceted since I enjoy learning about CS theory, the applications of Data Science, Economics, and Statistics (mostly probability). I took CS70 last year with Professor Rao and was also in CSM last semester as a student so I'm ready to use what I learned last year to pass it on to you all! Professionally, I've been a Machine Learning intern at the SF-based startup UnifyID last summer and will be on the Infrastructure Engineering team at Salesforce this coming summer. Outside of school, I love listening to Drake, taking landscape photographs, reading about streetwear, or eating a sandwich from Ike's. I'm also part of Berkeley Business Society, Cal Hacks, and Data Science Society on campus. I'm looking forward to having you all in my section and helping you get through CS70!   </td>

I took 70 last semester and (surprisingly) really enjoyed it. I'm from the LA area, specifically South Pasadena (it's actually a separate city from Pasadena!). I like outdoorsy stuff (hiking, fishing, flying, running), art (crafts, watercolor, lettering), playing basketball, binge-watching Netflix, sucking at (BUT TRYING) the ukelele, coding, anything aesthetic, and doing nothing. I'm in CSM because I love teaching and CS, so it seems like a good way to do both. Plus, CSM has really helped me, so wanted to help anyone that was in the same position that I was in last semester :) </td>
