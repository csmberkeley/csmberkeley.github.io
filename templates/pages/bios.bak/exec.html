I really enjoy the stats-y / math-y / algorithm-y side of CS and I've been teaching since the second semester of freshman year. I joined CSM in Fall 2016 as a 70 JM and I really fell in love with CSM and teaching 70! So I've continued doing both since! On the non-CS side of things, I like squealing at dogs, cooking Chinese food, piano, poetry, fountain pens and general stationery things, fashion, running, and boba! </td>

            <td class="bio">Internal Vice President. Hi! I began my journey in CSM as a freshman student in CS 61A, an experience that I found extremely helpful and an essential part of my success in the course. The following semester, I became a junior mentor while still taking CSM courses as a student, and it was then that CSM became not only a place that I went to for academic support, but also my community. I am now in my fifth semester of mentoring for CSM, and I have previously been a senior mentor and course coordinator. I am excited to help CSM continue to grow this semester and look forward to helping both mentors and students find their CS journeys at Cal. Please feel free to contact me with any suggestions/questions, thoughts about life, or grumblings about the state of Cal Athletics. Oh, and go Bears!</td>
