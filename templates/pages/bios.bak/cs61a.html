My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. He would drink, he would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark. Sometimes, he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy – the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical: summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring, we’d make meat helmets. When I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds. Pretty standard, really. I, myself, came to Berkeley to study Cognitive Science and Computer Science. 61A is the class I teach and I love working with students on concepts that really introduce them to the ultra logical form of thinking that comes with learning CS. I'm also on the club soccer team and enjoy films/music from the 80s onwards. Come talk to me whenever! </td>

In between my schoolwork and naps, I enjoy a bowl of cheerios while watching Stephen Colbert’s Late Show. I favor classical music (Glenn Gould, M. Rostropovich) but also a select few lyrics songs written between 1967-2003. In particular, I love having joke-ridden conversations about politics and polls, climate science, and the news.

I also enjoy AI and machine learning. In my free time, I listen to music and maybe studying it and try going to the San Francisco Symphony whenever I can. I also really need to pick up my violin again. Currently, I am involved with research. Unfortunately, outside of eating, I spend my Sundays being sad and doing homework like EECS would. Also I don't really have a favorite restaurant but I go to Sliver more times than I should especially give that they are in south side now.</td>

My CS journey started in my senior year of high school when I took my first computer science class, and I have taken the CS61 and EE16 series as well as CS70. I am currently taking CS188, 170, and CogSci 1 this semester since algorithms and artificial intelligence are big interests of mine. My programming experience is in Python, Java, and C. Outside of studying, I love listening to early 2000's music, browsing memes, being addicted to milk tea, practicing archery, and playing racing video games (but mostly memes tbh). I'm also taking a singing class and taking part with UAVs at Berkeley on the side just for fun. This is my first semester as a mentor at CSM, and I'm thrilled to be able to be part of a community that is focused on bringing people who love computer science closer. I hope that my sections can resemble a study group of close friends, and that we can expand our brains and have fun exploring computer science together!</td>

I liked CS61A so much last semester that I decided to do CSM in hopes of helping others enjoy the course rather than fear it. I have tutored one-on-one extensively in the past, so I am excited to teach a group of students for the first time. In my free time, I like looking at memes (e.g. the spaghet meme), lying in bed, and watching TV and anime. My favorite old art style is Mannerism painting because it's kind of uncomfortable to look at which amuses me for some reason. On Sundays, I go to church. My favorite food in Berkeley is the chicken from Shihlin; my favorite boba, Ucha. I am in AFX Dance. I feel like I am someone who really enjoys and appreciates life (or at least attempts to) and I try to not take any specific life thing too seriously. I really enjoy meeting new people and making friends, so I hope that this short bio was either relatable or interesting enough to inspire you to join my section. All in all, I think I am a pretty nice person (?). Thanks for reading, and I wish you good luck in your 61A journey!!</td>

I'm currently a project developer for Blueprint, an amazing student organization that makes software for nonprofits. When I was younger, I loved drawing comics with friends after school (Calvin and Hobbes was my inspiration), and the reason I first got into CS was because I wanted to turn my cartoon ideas into games people could play. One of my favorite personal projects, Magnet Ascent, started as a doodle in math class about a magnet strapped to a jetpack and became an iOS app that's received 18k downloads to date. I also care a lot about CS education, and spent my last two summers interning for Kodable, where I worked on a game to teach coding to millions of elementary school students worldwide. My hobbies include skiing, tennis, piano, and board games (Resistance/Pandemic/Codenames are some of my favorite!).</td>

I love listening to R&B and hip hop, playing board games, and watching the NBA. I really enjoyed my time in 61A and I hope you do too. Come talk to me about anything!</td>

          ~ Screaming my head off during kendo practice
          ~ "Studying" in the Moffitt 5th Floor sleeping lounge
          ~ Deciding whether to play LoL, Path of Exile, or XCOM 2 when the correct answer is "None of the above"
          ~ Chili and curry rice, because those are the only recipes I know how to cook
          ~ Getting to meet you!</td>

This is my third semester leading CSM sections for 61A, and I'm excited for another semester! In CS, my interests are in human-computer interaction and data visualization, but I've enjoyed courses in systems, networking, and, of course, 61A! Outside of school and CS, I'm very much a homebody. But when I'm out, I do like to explore new food places and a good escape room is always fun. </td>
