My past-times: basketball and hiking. Fav artists right now: Alt-J and Marian Hill. I was a 61B mentor with CSM last semester and like to draw diagrams when I teach. I hope to share some of the insight I've gained from 61B with you. Remember: "The best things in life don't come easy."  :)</td>

I came into the major with zero programming experience. I've done many things related to CS61B (TA, lots of CSM roles, private tutoring, etc). I like to keep open communication with my students and having an open environment. Outside of school my hobbies include  cycling, basketball, climbing, finding new hobbies, and food! Feel free to contact me if you'd like to know more or if you just wanna chat! Email: sebsong@berkeley.edu</td>

          <td class="bio">Associate Mentor. 05:00 PM Thu. sruthiv123@berkeley.edu. Hey there! I'm a third-year Microbial Biology major and CS minor. CS 61B was the class that changed my view of computer science from "I suppose this is a necessary evil for the modern microbiologist" to "wow! This is so exciting!" When I have free time I enjoy running and reading science fiction, though nowadays you're most likely to find me napping.</td>

I had no CS background coming into college but here I am today, whoo! I've been with CSM for 2 years now and I really enjoy teaching. My hobbies include sleeping 14 hours a day, staying up late gaming, and drinking boba excessively. I take in those dank memes daily, play board games pretty frequently, and have a weird love for mini golf ever since I first tried it this past winter break. Catch me at tea press for my daily dose of addiction :^)</td>
