I took the first large-scale offering of EE 16A as a freshman, and I loved it! I also enjoy CS theory, and have TA'd CS 70 and 170. I'm very interested in learning how to improve educational outcomes, particular in fields like CS. In my free time, I enjoy reading about history and languages, and walking to the Big C.</td>

On campus when I'm not EECS-ing you'll find me working with AWE, building a solar car with CalSol, or beatboxing for the California Golden Overtones (Friday's 1pm on Sproul). Off campus I enjoy cooking, biking, and snowboarding. This semester I'm taking three core courses but more interestingly a seminar on Germany and a Berkeley Connect in philosophy.

My EE claim to fame is being commended by Professor Elad for walking all the way to Cory to give my friend his forgotten lab kit. During the (rare) hours where EECS isn't consuming my life, I like making beats with FLStudio, learning terminal commands to look cool, and complaining about Crossroads to anyone listening. My music tastes are all over the place from Migos to Ed Sheeran but I'm always looking for new music. My favorite eating place in Berkeley is Urbann Turbann, which is basically an Indian Chipotle! It's really good and hopefully, if you go and tell them I sent you then they'll give me free food? Anyways, I'm excited to be a CSM mentor and am looking forward to meeting you all!</td>

I fell in love with CS while playing around with JavaScript and random cybersecurity stuff as a sophomore/junior in high school, but EE 16AB convinced me that EE was way too cool to take only 2 classes on and now I'd say I have a foot firmly in each side of EECS. And maybe I just like hearing myself talk, but I find teaching fun too, so here I am! I've played soccer my whole life, and if I'm not studying or link-surfing Wikipedia, you'll probably find me playing IM Futsal at the RSF. I'm pretty much always listening to music, and even wrote a math-themed rap parody album with one of my friends for an AP Calc project in high school. I have wide-ranging tastes although I'd say Justin Timberlake and Green Day are my favorites. Not a huge movie buff but I do love the Fast and the Furious and Star Wars franchises. Looking forward to a great semester, and feel free to talk to me about any of the above! </td>
